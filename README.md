RockORMine

Using logistic regression to predict whether the data received by sonar indicates a mine or a rock.

This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression to predict whether sonar data collected by ships is indicative of a mine or a rock.
The dataset contains 60 features and 208 samples.
The logistic regression model used in this project is implemented using scikit-learn.

Why Logistic Regression? What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class (e.g., mine or rock) using a logistic function. It is ideal for this project because the output is categorical and binary in nature.
